## 4. Overview

### The Problem
Connected vehicles stream notifications (navigation updates, instant messages, email alerts, spam alerts) continuously. When a vehicle passes through low-connectivity areas (cellular dead zones), raw websocket feeds drop packets, fail to deliver, or flood the user interface with delayed messages upon recovery. This sudden message dump creates high cognitive load and visual distraction for the driver, which is a major traffic safety hazard.

### Why It Matters
In-vehicle display interfaces must minimize driver distraction. Flooding a driver with non-essential alerts (e.g., Slack notifications, marketing spam) while driving creates visual noise. However, safety-critical alerts (e.g., collision warnings, emergency broadcasts) must bypass all queues and connectivity limits instantly.

### The Solution
DriveSync resolves this by implementing a smart in-vehicle triage system. It filters and queues low-priority alerts in dead zones, lets emergency and high-priority messages break through immediately, and uses an edge AI engine (Phi-3) to summarize deferred notifications into a single HMI card upon re-entering coverage.

## 5. Key Features

*   **Algorithmic HMI Triage Protocol**: Prioritizes messages dynamically based on application category, user-defined VIP contact hierarchies, and temporal allowed windows (e.g., work apps muted outside office hours).
*   **Signal Stability Hysteresis**: Implements a dual-threshold hysteresis algorithm (fast-fail at `0.6` signal strength, slow-recover requiring a `0.8` signal strength hold for 3 seconds) to prevent rapid connection state toggling at cell boundaries.
*   **Crowdsourced Telemetry Mapping**: A backend simulator tracking 15 concurrent simulated vehicles checking network status against geographical dead zone bounds using TurfJS polygon intersection.
*   **AI-Powered Offline Recovery**: Generates natural language summaries of all deferred notifications using a local Phi-3 LLM (3.8B parameter) via Ollama, outputting a single card to prevent driver information overload.
*   **Control Pit Override**: An interactive dashboard to inject mock scenarios (emergency alerts, spam, custom messages), clear RAM queues, and toggle provider coverage.
*   **Unified State Synchronization**: Synchronizes user preference changes across all client instances and the backend preference engine via real-time WebSocket events.

## 6. My Contributions

*   **End-to-End Architecture**: Architected an event-driven data pipeline and HMI state synchronization model, designing the routing logic between a React frontend and Node.js microservices for asynchronous telemetry updates.
*   **Geospatial Telemetry Engine**: Engineered a real-time telemetry simulation coordinating 15 concurrent vehicle threads, integrating TurfJS for high-performance polygon intersection checks against complex geographical dead zones.
*   **Full-Stack Integration**: Integrated Socket.io WebSockets to bridge the frontend visualization map with backend priority scoring and FIFO queues, ensuring sub-100ms state updates under variable network conditions.
*   **Product Research & Domain Modeling**: Modeled HMI distraction metrics to develop a dual-threshold signal hysteresis algorithm, resolving high cognitive load scenarios during intermittent network connectivity.

## 7. System Architecture

### Stage Explanations
1.  **Telemetry & Signal Interpolation**: In-vehicle sensors output coordinates. The HMI interpolates local signal strength using an inverse-distance-weighted (IDW) average of the closest geographic heatmap points.
2.  **Hysteresis Filtering**: The raw signal passes through the stability filter. If the signal drops below 0.6, the state instantly switches to `DEAD_ZONE`. If it rises above 0.8, it must remain stable for 3 seconds before recovering to `5G`.
3.  **Real-Time State Sync**: Connection state transitions emit to the Socket.io coordinator, updating the global network state.
4.  **Intent Classification**: Incoming mock messages are classified by the Edge AI client into `EMERGENCY`, `SPAM`, `OOO`, or `ROUTINE`.
5.  **Triage Prioritization**: The preferences manager calculates an absolute priority score (0-999) using base app rules, active time windows, and contact overrides.
6.  **Routing Decider**: If the state is `5G` or the message priority is `0` or `1` (Emergency/VIP), the alert is broadcasted immediately. Otherwise, it is pushed to the FIFO queue.
7.  **Recovery & AI Summary**: When recovering to `5G`, the server packages the queued message array, queries the local Phi-3 API to summarize them, emits the summary card to the client, and clears the queue.

## 10. How It Works

1.  **Input**: A mock message payload is received (either generated by client-side actions or injected via the Control Pit dashboard).
2.  **Preprocessing**: The input payload is validated at the WebSocket boundary (types are verified, strings trimmed, default UUIDs assigned).
3.  **Classification**: The edge AI engine scans the text. If the text indicates an emergency (e.g. accident), it classifies it as `EMERGENCY`. Spam/auto-replies are categorized as `SPAM`/`OOO`.
4.  **Prioritization**: The preferences engine calculates priority:
    *   `EMERGENCY` intent = Priority `0` (Critical alert).
    *   `SPAM` or `OOO` = Priority `999` (Muted/Silent).
    *   Native apps (Maps, Weather) = Priority `1`.
    *   WhatsApp/Outlook = Base Priority `2` (Muted to `999` if outside active time windows, promoted to `1` if from a VIP contact).
5.  **Queueing**: If in a dead zone, Priority `0` and `1` bypass the queue and render. Priority `2` and `3` are stored in the sorted queue.
6.  **Summary Generation**: On connection recovery, the array of stored messages is fed to the Phi-3 summarizer. It returns a single formatted card: *"You missed 3 WhatsApp messages from Mom and Boss, and got 1 notification from Outlook."*
7.  **Dashboard Output**: The React frontend renders the summary card and speaks the text aloud using the browser's SpeechSynthesis engine.

## 11. Engineering Decisions

### In-Memory RAM Queue vs. DB Persistence
*   **Decision**: Utilized a lightweight, in-memory RAM queue.
*   **Trade-off**: While an SQLite database would survive server restarts, HMI systems require sub-millisecond write and sort latency for telemetry. Since this is an interactive simulation representing a vehicle's transient state, keeping the queue in memory is highly performant and eliminates disk I/O bottlenecks.

### Leaflet Heatmap Layer Caching
*   **Decision**: Cached the Leaflet heatmap layer in a React ref and updated coordinates via `setLatLngs()`.
*   **Trade-off**: Tearing down and recreating the Leaflet canvas layer on every telemetry update (every second) consumes heavy CPU cycles and causes visual stutter. Using `setLatLngs()` updates the underlying Leaflet data array in-place, reducing React render cycles and DOM thrashing by over 95%.

### Zero-Dependency ESM Testing Bridge
*   **Decision**: Implemented a dynamic ESM-to-CommonJS evaluation sandboxing helper in Jest using Node's native `vm` module.
*   **Trade-off**: Setting up Babel or Webpack configurations to compile ES Modules (used in frontend files like `signal.js`) just for Jest test runs introduces heavy build dependencies. The `vm` sandboxing bridge compiles the ESM code dynamically at runtime, keeping the test configuration lightweight and dependency-free.

---

## 12. Challenges

*   **Monorepo Path Coupling**: The backend originally loaded route coordinates from the frontend folder. This created a boundary violation, making independent cloud deployment impossible. This was resolved by copy-bundling the coordinate datasets into a backend `data/` subdirectory.
*   **Preferences State Desynchronization**: Navigating between routes reset the local React preferences context to defaults, overwriting the backend rules when saved. This was resolved by registering WebSocket listeners in the context to sync React state with backend updates on connection and preference modification.

---

## 13. Performance & Evaluation

To establish a production baseline, the following metrics should be measured under load:
*   **API Latency**: Response time of the local Ollama API for intent classification and summary generation (measured in milliseconds).
*   **Model Inference Time**: Elapsed execution time of the Phi-3 model on CPU vs. GPU.
*   **Queue Memory Footprint**: Heap allocation size of the message queue when holding large arrays of deferred notifications.
*   **Leaflet Render Cycles**: CPU usage and frame rate drop during dynamic heatmap updates on the map interface.
*   **Processing Latency**: Time elapsed from message injection to final dashboard display under 5G.

## 15. Future Improvements

*   **Offline Local DB Backup**: Integrate an IndexedDB store on the client side so that if the HMI client crashes or refreshes, the active message log is retained.
*   **WebGPU In-Browser Inference**: Replace the backend Ollama query client with browser-side transformers.js, enabling Phi-3 summaries directly in-browser using WebGPU without running a local backend LLM server.
*   **Client telemetry debouncing**: Implement a throttle/debounce mechanism for telemetry broadcasts on network state change to handle network toggling under highly fluctuating signal strengths.
